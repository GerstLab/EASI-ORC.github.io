# EASI-ORC
The EASI-ORC pipeline can take you from raw images to analyzed data and graphs. It performs mRNA-ER colocalizaion analysis in a fast, reliable and consistent manner. All running on the Fiji platform, freely and openly.

Our [user guide](https://github.com/ShaharGarin/EASI-ORC/blob/c2f86e303f4534bf5d0a5a138059f861595184bd/EASI%20ORC%20User%20Guide.pdf) will take you step-by-step, explaining every module in detail.

Designed to work with NO coding.

## EASI-ORC can:
* Segment yeast cells.
* Segment organelles and other sub-cellular structures.
* Sub-segment organlles using a proximity marker.
* Identify FISH spots.
* Resolve mRNA-organelle colocalization.
* Filter, analyze and graph results.
